SUMMARY OF INTERNET PROTOCOL


Application Layer Protocols:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Similar to HTTP but adds a layer of encryption using SSL/TLS protocols to secure data transmission, commonly used for secure transactions over the internet.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Allows the transfer of files between a client and a server on a computer network.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending and receiving email messages between servers.

DNS (Domain Name System): Converts domain names to IP addresses, allowing users to access websites using human-readable addresses.

Transport Layer Protocols:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication by dividing data into packets, numbering them for sequencing, and reassembling them at the destination.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Offers faster but less reliable communication by transmitting data packets without establishing a connection or ensuring delivery.

Internet Layer Protocols:

IP (Internet Protocol): Assigns unique IP addresses to devices and routes data packets across networks based on these addresses. IPv4 and IPv6 are the two main versions of IP.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used for diagnostic and control functions, including error reporting and network testing.

Link Layer Protocols:

Ethernet: Defines the physical and data link layer specifications for wired local area networks (LANs).

Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11): Specifies the wireless communication standards for local area networks, allowing devices to connect to the internet without physical cables.

These protocols work together in a hierarchical manner to facilitate communication between devices on the internet, ensuring data transmission is efficient, reliable, and secure
