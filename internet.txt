SUMMMARY OF INTERNET AND ITS COMPONENTS

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and other devices that communicate using standardized protocols. It enables the exchange of data and information across the world.

The internet's origins trace back to ARPANET, a project initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense in the late 1960s. It has since evolved through various technological advancements and the development of protocols like TCP/IP.

The internet consists of hardware infrastructure (servers, routers, cables) and software protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS) that enable communication and data transfer.

Access to the internet can be obtained through ISPs (Internet Service Providers) via various technologies such as dial-up, DSL, cable, fiber-optic, and wireless connections.

The internet offers a wide range of services including email, web browsing, social media, online shopping, streaming media, online gaming, cloud computing, and more.
